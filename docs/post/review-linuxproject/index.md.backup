Thank you for kind review , i used a virtualbox to make this distro but next time i will build it on my computer on a seperate external disk there are a lot of stuff that need work, its purely experimental.
1) calamares asks for a password where it shouldn't
2) Sudoers file need modification
3) Some startup scripts to configure stuff 
4) A Supreme Utility Center to help with tasks that debian users usually do.
5) A plymouth theme and more sane and better wallpapers that would support the supreme linux logo.
6) A lot of Testing with computers with amd gpus,nvidia gpus ,intel etc it needs to have the drivers preinstalled.
7) Adding efi support cause virtualbox that i used to create this distro had some issues with that i don't know what seems to be the problem but next time i will build from my physical desktop computer on a seperate external hard disk.
 
 Again thank you for your time ... someone had to do a Debian Sid based distro .....

You can check and download the latest isos  from there
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1imwUDUyYh-LgGbwvbx5AXk_UD8-zGAU5?usp=sharing
note the its in experimental pre-alpha stage
The password for the installer is: supremelinux
Right now on the installed system you need to switch alt+f3 to a console and do
sudo nano /etc/sudoers file and add this line 
chris	ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Where chris is your own username
control+O enter    to save the changes
control+x  to exit

Things will be fixed later, also i would have to build the distribution on my laptop because the virtualbox had some problems booting from efi and the iso that i made has no support for EFI.

Supreme Linux , new site design !
Our github page Website is based on Hugo !

Supreme Linux is a brand new Debian Sid based Distribution with big ambitions ,right now its in experimental stage.

Roadmap in a hurry:

Part 1:  I'm trying to build the easiest , fastest,laptop energy efficient linux distro that would be easy to use for a newbie user , graphics drivers would be installed  by default latest nvidia drivers ,latest mesa/amdgpu. Bleeding edge packages, an elegant Supreme Utility Center easy to use to simplify debian/system management tasks for the newbies.

-Part 2:   A Bspwm respin  that would come with the Supreme Bspwm Manager to change themes and choose color for borders, change shortcuts etc.

-Part 3:  Creating my own Supreme Linux iso maker so the fans would create their own Isos

-Part 4:  Creating the Supreme Software Buitique a place to download software/debian packages that are not available on Debian repositories 

If you want to support our project and inform me that there is enough interest to start working with this project  share this website online or tell it to your friends.
